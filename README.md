# Calculator

## Description

This is a command-line calculator that performs basic math operations like addition, subtraction, mutliplication and division. It takes three arguments in the command-line including 2 numbers and one operator.

## Instructions

In your terminal, use this command -

node calculator.js (num1) (operator) (num2)

Replace

- (num1) with the first number
- (operator) with one of the following operators- [ "+" , "-" , "*" , "/" ]
- (num2) with the second number
- now just enter and you will get your result.

## Challanges

It was my first time using the process.argv function. It required a lot of research, including reading documentation and watching videos.
Also, dealing with different terminals like git bash and powershell. I learned that \* and / operators can have different behaviors depending on the terminal.
